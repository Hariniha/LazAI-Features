# 🤖 LazAI Mini Build – Alith Agent CLI

This project is a **mini build with LazAI using Alith Agent**.  
It demonstrates how to create a **CLI-based AI assistant** that can:

- 💬Chat – hold a multi-turn conversation with memory  
- 📝Summarize – condense a block of text into 2 sentences  
- 🏷 Classify– analyze sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral)  

## 🔑 Features in This Code

- Uses **Alith Agent** to connect with LazAI through the Groq API.  
- Provides a **command-line interface** where you type commands.  
- Supports three commands:
  - `chat <msg>` → continue a chat conversation
  - `summarize <text>` → summarize long text
  - `classify <text>` → classify sentiment  
- Includes **chat history**, so conversations feel natural and contextual.
